# Combinatorial fully connected implementations
Two initial approaches for implementing the fully connected BNNs
in a fully combinatorial single-cycle datapath are compared.
Only the first layer differs between them, the second layer stays
unchanged.

## Positive-Negative Sum

![Implementation with positive and negative sums split](./tikz1/tbpar.png)

For each neuron in the first layer two sums are calculated. $\Sigma^+_i$
is the sum of the input features for which the connection with the i_th_
hidden neuron has a positive weight , whereas $\Sigma^-_i$ the sum of
those that have a negative weight associated. The two sums are then
compared and if the positive sum is greater than or equal to the
negative the output of the neuron is 1, otherwise 0.
$$ \Sigma^+_i = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j [W1_{i,j} > 0] $$
$$ \Sigma^-_i = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} x_j [W1_{i,j} < 0] $$
$$ h_i = \Sigma^+_i \ge \Sigma^-_i $$

Sample code snippet:
```{.verilog}
assign positives[0] = + feature_array[1] + feature_array[2] + ... + feature_array[10];
assign negatives[0] = + feature_array[0] + feature_array[3] + feature_array[5];
assign hidden[0] = positives[0] >= negatives[0];
```

The reasoning behind splitting the sums is that keeping the operations
to only using unsigned positive numbers and only using addition and not
subtraction means simpler operations are required, and that may lead to
a smaller footprint.

For each neuron of the output layer it's value is calculated by summing
the output of hidden neurons. The binary output of the hidden neuron $s_j$is added as-is to the sum of the output neuron $y_i$ in the case that the weight of their connection $W2_{i,j}$ is positive and it's binary inverse is added to the sum if $W2_{i,j}$ is negative. This is equivalant to the sum of the xnor between the output vector of the hidden layer and the weight vector of the output neuron.

$$
y_i = \sum_{j=0}^{M-1} \begin{dcases}
    s_j,& \text{if } W2_{i,j} > 0\\
    \neg s_j,              & \text{if } W2_{i,j} < 0
\end{dcases}
$$

Code sample:

```{.verilog}
assign scores[0*SUM_BITS+:SUM_BITS] = + hidden_n[0] + hidden[1] + hidden[2] + ... + hidden_n[39];
```


## Signed sum

![Implementation a single sum per neuron](./tikz1/tbparsign.png)

In this version a single sum is calculated for each neuron. If the
connection between input feature $x_j$ and hidden neuron $h_i$ has
weight $W1_{i,j} = 1$ it is added to the sum, otherwise it is subtracted
from it. Basically adding the feature multiplied by either 1 or -1 is
hard-coded as the resulting addition or subtraction correspondingly.
The result is then compared to zero to give the binarized output of the
neuron. Since the result is a signed number, this just means taking the
sign bit.

$$
h_i = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \begin{dcases}
    + x_j,& \text{if } W1_{i,j} > 0\\
    - x_j,              & \text{if } W1_{i,j} < 0
\end{dcases}
$$

Code sample:
```{.verilog}
wire signed [8:0] intra_0;
assign intra_0 = - feature_array[0] + feature_array[1] + ... + feature_array[10];
assign hidden[0] = intra_0 >= 0;
```

The second layer's implementation is not changed from how it is
described above.

## Discussion
My prior expectation was that splitting the features into two sums to
avoid subtractions would lead to better results than keeping all the
operations for a neuron to a single expression by the reasoning
summarised previously. In fact it turns out that using a single sum
has area and power requirements 20-30% lower than using two.

My explanation for this is that keeping terms in separate expressions
prevents the compiler from effectively locating and reducing shared
subexpressions during synthesis. For example, if a neuron's expression
contains $+x_5+x_6-x_7$ and a different neuron contains $-x_5+x_6+x_7$
then the result of $x_5-x_7$ can be used for both neurons, but if $x_5$
and $x_7$ are not in the same expression, as they would not be in the
positive-negative sum implementation, this arithmetic optimization is
not used by the compiler. Additionally the two sums need comparators to
produce the binarized output of the neuron, whereas in the case the
signed sum this corresponds to the sign bit of the sum which means no
additional hardware.

\newpage

# Minimum range bit-width reduction

![title here](./parw_points.svg)

The reasoning goes that if the bitwidth that is demanded for the total
sum of the features is reduced, the bitwidth that partial sums it
depends on require lower on the adder graph is also reduced. As a
consequence, adders need to accomodate less bits and less logic ought to
be implemented for them.

At least in theory, the minimal circuit to implement the calculations of
the sums of the first layer with reduced widths for the results should
be strictly equal or smaller than the one with full widths. This is
because given a circuit that implements the full width calculations, the
reduced width results can be taken by selecting the bitrange of that
width from the least significant bits of the full width result. This is
simple wire selection and does not require any additional hardware,
therefore reducing neuron widths can never require additional logic.

So far in the first layer the bitwidth of the
total sum $h_i$ of the neuron is set to be large enough to fit any value
that may come up as the result of $M$ additions and subtractions of 4-bit
unsigned numbers. The assumption is that this range is significantly
wider than the range of values the neuron actually takes during
evaluation of typical samples. This would mean the bitwidth can be
lowered without errors due to overflows or underflows coming up in
actual use of the design, and this lowering would improve performance.

To test this the total sum of each neuron $h_i$ is calculated for each
sample in the dataset. I get the minimum and maximum of these values.
Since all values for the total sum to take are contained in the range
between those two, the arithmetic operations need not accomodate any
range larger than that.  Let $H^i_j$ be the value of $h_i$ when
evaluating the j_th_ sample of the dataset, and $wh_i$ be the bitwidth
of the i_th_ hidden neuron.

$$h_{i max} = \max\limits_{j=0}^{S-1} H^i_j$$
$$h_{i min} = \min\limits_{j=0}^{S-1} H^i_j$$
$$ wh_i = \lceil \log_2(\max(h_{i max},\lvert h_{i min}\rvert -1)) \rceil+1 $$

## Discussion

The results are negligible, in the 1-3% range, and in the
case of pendigits they even deteriorate a bit. This deterioration
should not be possible in theory if the synthesised circuits are optimal
implementations of their description. This is at least evidence that the
negligible results on the other datasets can be better if I can get
them into a form the compiler can work better with, though I still think
the main problem is with the approach itself. It seems that the
truncation goes against best practices and blocks the datapath
extraction process for some neurons, so certain optimizations do not get
applied to them and some would be common resources do not get shared. I
have not found a method to work around this limitation at this point.

\newpage

# Range centering

![title here](./parce_points.svg)

## Rationale

Unfortunately I make a mistake when initialy evaluating the results of
limiting the bitwidth of neurons in the previous part. The blunder is
accidentaly comparing the results with the positive-negative sums full
width circuit instead of the single signed sum version that the reduced
width circuits are based on. This causes me to falsely believe that
reducing the bitwidths of computations is much more effective than in
reality. Based on this misanderstanding I pursue finding ways to further
reduce the ranges of values each neuron's total has to support. After
realising the mistaken assumption I don't think those efforts were
justified. The first of these is the attempt to "center" the range of
values so the maximum and minimum values are at an equal distance from
zero.

The range of values a neuron of the first layer can take can be
significantly unbalanced. What this means is that if for example the
feature the hidden neuron tracks occurs infrequently, it will equally
infrequently take positive values, and this suggests that the negative
values it takes can get much large in an absolute sense than the
positive ones get a chance to. If the absolute minimum or maximum value
is multiple times larger than the other one, let's say $h_{i max} = 10
h_{i min}$, then the range of values the bitwidth of the neuron must
support is up to twice as large as the one of the equivalant range
balanced so it's maximum value is as far from zero as it's minimum.

Therefore by subtracting the value that lies at the middle of the range
from the result, the bitwidth of the neuron's sum can be further
reduced. That requires an additional constant subtraction operation for
the calculation of the sum and an additional comparison operation, since
the result needs to be compared to the same constant for binarization
unlike being compared to zero that needs no additional hardware.
However, the hope is that if the width of enough intermediate results of
the adder graph and thus the number of full adders is reduced as a
result it will be enough to more than make up for the cost.

Example: if the highest value the total of the neuron takes
is 300 and the lowest is -100, we need a 10 bit signed integer to fit
all values. If we subtract their average(100) the values will be in
the range -200 to 200, so they fit in a 9 bit signed integer.

$$h_{i max} = \max\limits_{j=0}^{S-1} H^i_j$$
$$h_{i min} = \min\limits_{j=0}^{S-1} H^i_j$$
$$h_{i mid} = \lceil \frac{h_{i max} + h_{i min}}{2} \rceil $$
$$ h'_i = h_i - h_{i mid} $$
$$ wh'_i = \lceil \log_2(\lceil \frac{h_{i max} - h_{i min}}{2} \rceil) \rceil+1 $$

The additional operations are only included in the design for neurons
that this method decreases the bitwidth compared the one calculated from
the "unbalanced" range. For the rest there is no reason to incur the
overhead for no benefit so they are declared the same as they are using
minimum range bit-width reduction.

## Discussion
The results show that the hardware requirements of the additional
operations were not covered by the reduced bitwidths and area and power
demands considerably increased. Given the actual results of how much
reducing bitwidths helps from above this is not surprising. In fact it
seems counter-intuitive that for the winered dataset's model it lead to a
6% improvement.

Notably, this was the model that had the most benefit
from the previous bitwidth reduction as well. I estimate this model's
operations in the first layer lend themslves less to arithmetic
optimizations compared to the rest, and thus hindering that optimization
process is not as rough a sacrifice.

It also seems probable that subtracting a simpler constant than the
actual value at the middle of the range $h_{i mid}$, for example the
nearest power of two, would lessen the computational burden of the
additional subtraction and comparison, but not enough to be worth
implementing.

\newpage

# Naively reducing bitwidths of intermediate results
## Rationale

Given the eventual goal of applying approximate computation techniques to
the adder graph of the designs a problem, mentioned previously, comes
up. If the approximation, whatever it may be, gets applied separately to
each neuron's sum, almost certainly blocks the datapath extraction
process from performing arithmetic optimizations such as reducing and
sharing common subexpressions across neurons. The result is $M$ separate
approximate adder trees. Even given that the logic reduction gained from
approximate additions for each adder tree is more than enough to offset
the lost benefit of intermediate result sharing, that may be an
unnecessary concession.

To estimate how large the negative effect of an approximation technique
not taking cross-neuron sharing into consideration could be, I reduce
the bitwidths of intermediate results of the sum of each neuron.
Even though this would reasonably help for a single neuron, I expect it
will cause resource sharing to break. Given how large the negative
effect is I can check if this is a problem than ought to be fixed before 
approximation can confidently be applied.

## Implementation

![The intermediate sums of the sequential calculation of hidden neuron
28 for all of the Har dataset and the bit range needed to support each
step](./stepw_lines.svg)

The cumulative sum along the input features multiplied by the weight of
their connection with the neuron $i$ is calculated for each hidden
neuron and for each sample of the dataset. The maximum and minimum
values over all samples at each step of the cumulative sum for a given
neuron is then calculated. In a similar fashion to the method described
above for reducing the bitwidth of the total result of the neuron's
operations, the operations are written sequentially with the result of
each having it's bitwidth set based on the range of values for the
equivalent step of the sum for all of the dataset.

Let $h_{i,j}$ denote the result of the pre-activation value of the
$i$-th hidden neuron only taking into account the input features $x_0$ to
$x_j$, or equivalently the value of $h_i$ if $x_{j+1}$ to $x_{N-1}$ are
masked to zero.

$$ h_{i,j} =  \sum_{k=0}^{j} x_k W1_{i,k} $$
$$ hmax_{i,j} = \max\limits_{l=0}^{S-1} \sum_{k=0}^{j} D_k^l W1_{i,k} $$
$$ hmin_{i,j} = \min\limits_{l=0}^{S-1} \sum_{k=0}^{j} D_k^l W1_{i,k} $$
$$ wh_{i,j} = \lceil \log_2(\max(hmax_{i,j},\lvert hmin_{i,j}\rvert -1)) \rceil+1 $$

Sometimes due to the order of additions and subtractions the width
needed at a later step is less than the one of an earlier step. This
is because every sample for which there would be an overflow in the
earlier step with the smaller width would at some following feature
underflow back in the range it supports. This has been taken into
account. If a width of a subsequent operation's result is smaller, the
bitwidth of the previous addition/subtraction is simply set to that
smaller value.

$$ wh'_{i,j} = \min\limits_{k=j}^{N-1} wh_{i,j} $$

Consecutive operations that have the same result bitwidth are grouped
together and expressed in verilog as a single sum. I have not confirmed
if this does in fact affect the result of synthesis at all but it seems
to conform closer to the recommendations of the best practices guide.

## Discussion

The results were positive for two of the models with the smallest count
of input features $N$, which means that this method performed better
than the initial expectation. However, the optimization loss from losing 
shared operations shows clear scaling with the number $N$ of input
features. With more elements to sum, more common subexpressions to
optimise ought to come up, so this is keeping with expectations.

At the network with the largest $N$, the one belonging to gasId, which
has 128 sensor features, it has gotten bad enough to almost double the
area and power requirements. This shows that the issue is indeed
considerable when there is more than a handful of inputs, and ways to
work around it shall be searched for.

\newpage

# Preemptive arithmetic optimization

![placeholder](./tikz1/tbpaar.png)

## Rationale
Based on the results from above I attempt to get the arithmetic
expression that the design computes after synthesis, with the intent
of fitting later approximation techniques to it rather than having the
approximations dictate the graph of operations and forego these
advantages.

Design compiler provides an "*resource and datapath extraction*" report,
which quoting the user guide "analyzes the arithmetic contents of the
design and provides feedback so you can improve the RTL code as
needed". In this report the arithmetic operations that are performed
post-optimization by each datapath block are described in the block's
resource section. From this an addition / subtraction graph from input
elements to layer outputs could be reconstructed with relatively
straightforward parsing.

Unfortunately, the report does not provide a
mapping between the symbols it uses for input and output
variables of the datapath blocks and the corresponding wires in the
original design. Due to this the reconstructed adder graph cannot be
used to implement the network's layers before the inputs and outputs are
otherwise labeled.

Conceivably a method that unfolds all intermediate steps of the
calculation into full explicit sums of input variables for each output
variable could be used to achieve this labeling. After all intemediate
variables / nodes of the adder graph are eliminated (for example, $x =
a + b; y_1 = c + x; y_2 = d - x;$ would be expanded to $y_1 = c + a + b;
y_2 = d - a - b;$) the addition and subtraction operations can be mapped
to a matrix with binary {-1, 1} weights. A permutation matrix that turns
the original weight matrix of the layer into this reconstructed matrix
is then searched for, and the permutations are assigned as the labels of
the input and output elements of the adder graph.

Another path around this problem comes from the inclusion of references
to the operator or operators in the original verilog design that is
implemented by a given arithmetic operation mentioned in a datapath
block's report. These references only point to the line of the verilog
file the operator apears in, so to narrow it down with certainty the HDL
file must beformated in a way that only a single arithmetic operator
occurs per line.Then the variables named as operants in the report can
be matched to the variables associated with the operator in the line or
lines pointed to.

Some early attempts in this direction are made but it becomes clear that
a process that involves the network to be implemented in an HDL,
synthesized, reverse engineered from the synthesised result, implemented
in HDL in a different way and re-synthesised would require considerably
more complex orchestration than first impressions imply. Even if it
panned out without any issues the speed with which modifications to the
designs could be tried out would be slowed down to a degree I was not
comfortable with.

As an alternative I search the literature for algorithms or heuristics
that would perform an equivalent arithmetic optimization to the one
Design Compiler provides. It does not appear too hopeful that a de facto
standard method for such cases exists and perhaps even is the one used
under the compiler's hood, so the operations found are exactly or close
to the same. 

![An example of a datapath block's extraction report. An intermediate
value that is reused multiple times is highlighted.](./pics/extraction_report.png)

## Implementation

A formulation of the problem is the following:  Given a list of
expressions of the general form $y_i = x_0 + x_1 - x_2 - ... + x_n$ in
which operants can be shared between the expressions find the minimum
number of additions or subtractions that need to be performed to
evaluate all expressions. 

The problem turns out considerable less well-studied than initially
expected. While the deceptively simple description suggests a
straightforward way to answer it, it is NP-Complete difficult, more
specifically in the MaxSNP family of optimization problems. As a direct
result only approximate solutions are attempted. [guy] searches for
exact solutions by leveraging SAT solvers, but only manages to get this
to work for very small matrix sizes up to 8 x 8. Not much is else found
on the exact scenario above, but a close-enough problem having to do
with factoring similar lists of expressions of the form $y_i = x_0
\oplus x_1 \oplus ... \oplus x_n$ using the minimum possible XOR
operations is actively worked on thanks to some applications in the
field of cryptographic accelerators. Both belong to the shortest linear
program family of problems.

I choose to try utilising Paar's factoring algorithm [paar] first. It is
older than most heuristics that have been applied to the XOR factoring
problem, but has the advantage of not exploiting term cancellation.
Thanks to the property $x \oplus x = 0$ some optimal solutions to the
XOR problem include two subexpressions containing the same term $x$
being combined by XOR to produce a desired expression that does not
include $x$. Heuristics developed after Paar's take advantage of this
feature, and while there is a parallel between it and the term
cancellation of opposites in our scenario ($x - x = 0$ or $x + -x = 0$)
I have not managed to find the adjustments needed to apply their
insights to the new domain. Thus I give precedence to the more
straightforward method, that directly translates to using addition in
place of parity.

\newpage

## Paar's algorithm

It is essentially a greedy algorithm that picks the two elements that
are common in the largest number of expressions each time and adds the
result of their XOR to the list of elements.

Let $N$ be the number of inputs, $M$ be the count of expressions to
evaluate, $x_i$ be the $i$-th input, $y_i$ the $i$-th expression and $A
\in M\times{N}$ be the binary matrix we aim to factor. The value of
$A_{i,j}$ is set to 1 if the term $x_j$ is included in the XOR
expression $y_i$ and 0 otherwise.

For example if $N = 4$ the expression $y_i = x_0 \oplus x_2$ corresponds
to the row $A_i = [1 0 1 0]$.

The following steps are repeatedly applied:

1. Find the two columns $A_{:,i}$ and $A_{:,j}$ that have the bitwise
   AND with the largest weight. This corresponds to the columns with the
   largest dot product, so they can quickly be calculated by $i,j =
   \arg\max\limits_{k>l} (A^T A)_{k,l}$. This corresponds to finding the
   operation between two inputs or intermediate results that occurs the
   most times across all expressions.

2. Append the resulting product column  $A_{:,N} = A_{:,i} \land
   A_{:,j}$ to $A$. Increase $N$ by one to reflect the new width of the
   matrix. Intuitively this translates to including $x_i \oplus x_j$ as
   a new intermediate result $x_N$ to be used in farther operations.

3. Set $A'_{:,i} = A_{:,i} \land \neg A_{:,j}$ and $A'_{:,j} = A_{:,j}
   \land \neg A_{:,i}$. Thusly the dependence of expressions to $x_i$
   and $x_j$ is removed when it is now covered by the inclusion of $x_i
   \oplus x_j$ in them.

In the end only one element in each row has value $1$, and the index $j$ of
the column the only $1$ of the $i$-th row occurs in tells as the input
or intermediate result the $i$-th expression equals, $y_i = x_j$.

Paar's algorithm can work for a group of expressions that consist only
of addition, but the expressions we have to work with include both
additions and subtractions. To reconcile this issue the negative of each
input element is treated as a separate input element that is added where
the original would be subtracted. Given the original weight matrix $W$ with
$W_{i,j} \in {-1, 1}$ denoting whether element $x_j$ is added or
subtracted from the expression $y_i$, we construct the matrix $A$ we pass as
the initial state to the algorithm by first turning all the $-1$
elements to $0$ and then appending the inverse of the matrix to itself,
or $A = \max(0,[W,-W])$.

From this process a list $L$ of successive indices such that $L_n =
(i,j) \iff x_n = x_i + x_j$ is acquired, and the additions implied by
them are hardcoded in the verilog description of the designs.

## Extension to support subtractions

I try a slight modification to the original procedure so it can be
compatible with expressions including subtractions. The way I
described previously to use negative inputs with Paar's strategy often
has to unnecessarily repeat calculations. For a minimal example, the expressions $y_0 = x_0 - x_1 + x_2, y_1 = x_0 + x_1 - x_2$
would result in 4 operations ($x_3 = x_0 + -x_1, y_0 = x_3 + x_2, x_4 = x_0
+ x_1, y_1 = x_4 + -x_2$), instead of the 3 needed ($x_3 = x_1 - x_2, y_0 = x_0 + x_3,
y_1 = x_0 - x_3$). This can be avoided by taking the ability to subtract
instead of only add intermediate results into account.

In summary this works by using {-1, 0, 1} for the elements of the
matrix $A$, where $A_{i,j} = -1$ when the expression for $y_i$ contains
the negative of the value $x_j$. Instead of counting the number of (1,1)
pairs of elements for columns as before, the count of pairs of elements
that are either (1,1) or (-1,-1) corresponds to the number of times the
sum of the values is used, and the count of pairs of elements
that are either (1,-1) or (-1,1) corresponds to the number of times the
difference of the values is used. As before the operation that occurs in
the most expressions is chosen as the next operation to be implemented.

Finding these two counts for all pairs of columns can still be done with
a matrix multiplication like before so the new approach is not much
slower.

## Discussion

I expected that either:

1. The results of hardwiring the order of operations for calculating the
   pre-activation result of the neurons using Paar's heuristic would be
   considerably worse than the result of letting Design Compiler use the
   results of it's own optimization heuristics, since they ought to have
   implemented the best known ones. In this case trying an alternative
   to preemptively optimise the operations beforehand is most likely
   wasted effort because finding a competitive heuristic would be harder
   than parsing the results of their solution.

2. The results would have a negligible difference, because the
   heuristics used are related and / or the quality of results that can
   be expected by current methods for reasonable compute budgets hits a
   certain ceiling for the various approaches. In this case applying
   approximation techniques to the estimated arithmetic operation graph
   can go ahead.

The results show that although it is not consistant across the networks,
there is an improvement of 20-30% to the area and power estimates of
the smallest ones. This causes suspicion, since if such an old and
common algorithm performed better for some cases of the problem they
would reasonably have simply used it already. I initially look for
ways the original designs could be obstructing datapath extraction more
than they should, but nothing jumps out to me.

There seems to be a scaling in effect where the size of the weight
matrix or the number of total operations are inversely correlated with
how well Paar's algorithm performs compared to the compiler's unknown
solution. I hypothesise that they chose the methods they did for
arithmetic optimization giving more weight to the performance on heavier
workloads, where the savings are more important, or alternatively the
trade-offs these methods consider apply better to heavier loads. This
leaves some wiggle room for improvement in the sizes of the examined
networks.

Unfortunately, the issue I am trying to address has to do with
performance losses from disrupting compiler's arithmetic optimizations
scaling with model size, and the relative performance of the alternative
heuristic scales inversely with that size. This means that the attempted
fix cannot apply to the cases that need it most, so the underlying
problem remains unresolved.

The ternary take on Paar's heuristic outperforms the original by a
relatively consistant ratio with exception of the Har model's network.
This gives me some hope that applying more advanced heuristics used in
Shortest Linear Programs modefied for this particular usecase would
raise the network size threshold for which results can be improved.
